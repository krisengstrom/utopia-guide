<h2 id="section-1">Using your Thieves</h2>

<img src="images/bocan.png" alt="Bocan">

<p>Moving through the shadows, our thieves are an essential part to our kingdom operations to obtain information about our enemies and disrupt their operations. The success rate of our operations depends on our thievery effectiveness relative to that of our enemy. Thievery effectiveness is primarily determined by the number of thieves we have in relation to the size of our lands. Factors that contribute to our overall thievery effectiveness may include racial and personality bonuses, our honour level, our investment in Crime science, and any Thieves’ Dens we have built. However – no matter how effective our thieves, they can also be thwarted by our enemies’ Watch Towers, or the Clear Sight spell.  Our thieves rely heavily on their ability to remain stealthy and slip in and out of the shadows, as such they will not perform any actions once their stealth drops below 10%.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Thief Operations</h2>

<p>Gathering intelligence on your enemies is a crucial part of warfare and our thieves have a variety of different operations to obtain this information. To ensure accurate results, you should send 10% of your thieves on each infiltration</p>
