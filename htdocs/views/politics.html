<h2 id="section-1">Choosing a leader</h2>

<p>A Kingdom consists of up to 25 individual provinces. In a fun twist, kingdoms have both a monarchical and democratic approach to leadership. Every kingdom needs a King or Queen to guide the team; however, you actually VOTE for the Monarch.</p>

<p>The primary method of selecting a Monarch is for each province to vote for their choice. The selected leader for the kingdom is the one that receives at least 50% of the votes, with a lead of at least 2 votes over the runner-up. Every province receives one vote with the founding of their lands; however, as the age progresses we may find our nobility rank increasing which will award us a greater number of votes.</p>

<p>The secondary method is ruthless and very uncommon, this is to seize control. If our kingdom has at least three provinces and we have more than 50% of the kingdom's total networth, then whoever we vote for will become the Monarch.</p>

<p>Those best suited for Monarchy are not always those who are the best or most active players; rather, they are the ones most inclined to support the kingdom’s interests, communicate shared goals and lead the team towards the achievement of these goals.</p>

<p>Being the Monarch of a kingdom is a significant responsibility - not only do Monarchs represent their kingdoms in the eyes of the Utopian community, they also have a number of powers which have a significant effect on the lives of those under their rule.</p>

<p>Monarch responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Declare war, withdraw from war, and negotiate mutual peace agreements with war opponents</li>
	<li>Offer and accept diplomatic agreements between Kingdoms</li>
	<li>Change the Kingdom's stance</li>
	<li>Edit the Monarch Message on the throne page</li>
	<li>Manage the Kingdom forums</li>
	<li>Start and cancel dragons</li>
	<li>Invite new recruits</li>
	<li>Erect a Wall around the Kingdom to prevent new recruits from joining the ranks</li>
	<li>Change the Kingdom's name and banner</li>
	<li>Appoint another player as Steward</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-2">Stewardship</h2>

<p>Once elected, a Monarch also has the ability to appoint a Steward to assist him or her in governing the kingdom. The Steward has most of the powers a monarch does, however a Steward cannot alter the kingdom’s name or banner, recruit new provinces or erect the Wall.</p>

<p>Many Monarchs seek support from other experienced kingdom members, in addition to their Steward. Kingdom leadership structures vary between kingdoms, and may include war leaders, thief leaders, mage leaders, dedicated mentors for new provinces, or a number of other roles. Your kingdom and its nominated leaders are your main source of support and guidance as a fledgling province in Utopia.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Communications within your Kingdom</h2>

<p>One of the keys to a successful kingdom is effective communication. To support this, the Utopian Lords have provided numerous methods for us to take advantage of. As with any communication, the tone and content should be respectful and avoid foul language.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Mail</span> - A direct private message between two provinces. Mail can be sent to those outside our kingdom as well as those within. Monarchs and Stewards have the ability to send a mail to everyone in their kingdom at once.</li>
	<li><span class="red">ReverbIM chat</span> - A private chat that only our kingdom can access - Best used for casual conversation and real-time strategy and aid requests.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Forum</span> - A private forum that only our kingdom can access. Many kingdoms use their forums for introductions, discussing kingdom goals, build and military suggestions, and other information that could be referenced and used regularly. Monarchs and stewards have the ability to remove posts from kingdom forums.</li>
	<li><span class="red">War Forum</span> - During war, a temporary forum is created and shared between both kingdoms. War forums can be a fun place for some friendly intra-kingdom banter during the war and to share compliments and suggestions during End of War Ceasefire. As with our kingdom forums, the Monarch and Steward of both warring KDs are permitted to remove posts from the War Forum.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-4">Mentor Chat</h2>
<p>A new feature added in Age 75 is the Mentor Chat system. This chat allows you to reach out to a special group of Utopians that have been selected to help answer any and all questions the newest Lords and Ladies of Utopia may have. They are an amazing fount of information and are always available to assist you! And don't worry, only they can see your questions, other players can't see your chat and the mentors can't see your province so you don't have to worry about painting a target on your province as a newer player.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Recruitment</h2>

<p>Monarchs have the ability to invite new players to join our kingdom. A new leader can either establish their own province or take over an abandoned province. A player moving into a free space in the kingdom can choose their own race, personality, ruler and province name. Meanwhile, a player moving into an already established province will assume command of that province in its current state. We could inherit a healthy province ready to go, or take on the challenge of a hollowed shell that needs some serious work. Either way, joining a strong kingdom can be well worth the move. Live long and flourish!</p>

<h2 id="section-6">Aid</h2>

<p>Our kingdom is like our family and a good team can be stronger than just the sum of its parts. At times, either we or our kingdom-mates may require additional assistance, and support can be provided by sending certain resources. When we send aid our trade balance increases; however, it also decreases when we receive aid. The values for each resource are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 Gold Coin = 1 Gold Coin trade value
	<li>1 Bushel of food = 0.05 Gold Coins trade value
	<li>1 Soldier = 100 Gold Coins trade value
	<li>1 Rune = 3 Gold Coins trade value
</ul>

<p>While there are no benefits from having a positive trade balance, once our negative trade balance reaches 4 times our networth, incoming shipments will be taxed. The rate of tax on incoming shipments increases as our trade deficit worsens, so we must be mindful of how we manage our resources! However, the Utopian Lords are forgiving - as time progresses, our trade balance will slowly balance out bringing us closer to a zero trade balance.</p>

<h2 id="section-7">Stances</h2>

<p>A kingdom's stance is a declaration to the world of our kingdom's intentions and is controlled by the Monarch and Steward. There are three stances to choose from:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Normal</span> - A neutral stance with no inherent bonuses or drawbacks.
	<li><span class="red">Aggressive</span> - Higher combat gains and faster attack speed at the cost of higher wages and more military losses
	<li><span class="red">Fortified</span> - Reduced military training and construction costs, reduced military training and construction time, increased drafting speed, plus higher birth rates at a penalty of no new scientists or progression, significantly higher exploration costs and no paradise spell. Additionally, attack gains are significantly reduced whether attacking from or into a Kingdom that is in Fortified stance. While the protections provided to Fortified Kingdoms slide in over 24 hours, the penalties for attacking from Fortified stance are immediate.
</ul>

<p>There are also several restrictions on the changing of stances, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You may not change from Normal or Aggressive stance until 24 Days have passed</li>
	<li>You may not re-enter Fortified stance until 96 hours have passed</li>
	<li>Fortified stance will last for only 72 Days, after which you will be automatically placed into Normal stance</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-8">The Hostile Meter</h2>

<p>All relations between our Kingdom and others must be recorded. There are several levels of relations that are possible, which include: Normal, Unfriendly, Hostile, War, and Non-Aggression Pact. Each level provides varying effects on how our Kingdoms interact. Relations become more Hostile with each attack made between our Kingdoms. While just the contrary with each new Utopian month that begins, the hostility levels between our Kingdoms will decay slightly until Normal relations resume, however this can take many months depending on the amount of hostile actions that took place so beware the consequences of attacking the same Kingdom frequently.</p>

<p>Relation levels can be found on each Kingdom page so be sure to check before making any hasty decisions. We also have the option to view a hostile meter which allows us to keep track of the detailed status of the aggressive actions between our Kingdoms that shows how close we are to the next level of relations. This can be purchased from the shop as a personal item or a Kingdom wide item. The relations from passive to most aggressive are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Non-Aggression Pact:</span> A non-aggression pact entered into by two kingdoms prevents any attacks and aggressive sorcery and thievery operations. It will cancel out all previous relations and hostile actions between the two kingdoms.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Normal:</span> The default relation with all kingdoms that has no special benefits.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Unfriendly:</span> Once this level is reached additional more powerful and destructive sorcery and thievery operations become available to your opponent</li>
	<li><span class="red">Hostile:</span> Once Kingdom relations escalate to this level, the enemy Kingdom will receive additional bonuses such as: increased combat gains, reduced attack time and the mana/stealth cost of operations is reduced to 2%</li>
</ul>

<p>Each attack generates hostility points. Traditional Marches, Plunders, Abducts, Massacres and Razes generate 2 points whereas all other attacks generate 1 point. Unfriendly is achieved at 5 points and Hostile is achieved at 15 points.</p>

<p>The Hostile Meter has a cap of 150 points, you can still keep hitting once you reach this cap but we won't gain any further points. Should both kingdoms choose to keep hitting without pressing the button, war will automatically be declared if both kingdoms reach the cap. However, if only one kingdom repeatedly hits while the other does not, once the difference between the Hostile Meter reaches 100, the gains of the hostile kingdom will decline. If one kingdom is at 150 and the other has 0, then gains are reduced by 50%.</p>

<h2 id="section-9">Going to War</h2>

<p>The hostile meter counts all attacks that are made between Kingdoms. You have the option to make this visible to yourself or your Kingdom by way of a shop item purchase, regardless as to whether you can see the meter or not it is always counting. Successful traditional marches, razes, plunders and abducts on an enemy Kingdom will add 2 points to your hostility level towards that kingdom, all other attacks will add 1 point. Once 5 points is reached your Kingdom will become Unfriendly towards the enemy. Once 15 points is reached you will be Hostile. Going to war requires that at least 1 Kingdom is Hostile while the other be at least Unfriendly towards the other. War can only be declared by the Kingdom that is less hostile than their enemy. Several other factors must also be consider, such as whether the Kingdoms fighting are similar in size and whether or not at least 2 provinces from each Kingdom have attacked each other. If these factors are all met, prepare your troops for battle and be ready to declare war. </p>

<p>This is not the only way to achieve war, however. If some of the restrictions for war are not met, war may still be declared but there must be significant hostilities between the Kingdoms. If Kingdoms grow to loathe each other to such length as to both reach the max of the hostile meter, which is 150 points, then either Kingdom may declare war on the other. It should be noted however, that if all restrictions are not satisfied and war is declared in this way, there will be no rewards to the victor.</p>

<p>War will continue for at minimum 48 days, after which one side may surrender leaving their enemies the victor to receive a bounty of rewards. A Kingdom may only surrender if there have been no attacks made for at least 2 days. If neither Kingdom feels they have lost the war, a Mutual Peace may be end the war which will grant rewards to neither side. Lastly, if war rages on for 7 months and one Kingdom has become more than double the size of their opponent the Utopian Lords will force a surrender.</p>

<p>I will now go into more detail of the specifics of war. Once we begin war there are several bonuses we are granted. War can be an exciting time for your people; they will move quicker, fight harder and seclude themselves from the harsh outside world granting protection from invaders. Here is a list of what to expect when war commences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>10% faster attack speed</li>
	<li>Massacre will do significantly more damage</li>
	<li>Raze destroys buildings instead of land</li>
	<li>Mana and stealth costs for offensive spells and operations reduced to 2%</li>
	<li>Significantly more expensive exploration costs</li>
	<li>Paradise spell unavailable</li>
	<li>A protection from attacks not within our war will grow up to 75% throughout the first month</li>
</ul>

<p>After 12 hours:</p>

<ul>
	<li>20% faster attack speed</li>
</ul>

<p>After 24 hours:</p>

<ul>
	<li>25% reduced military losses</li>
	<li>25% reduced military training time</li>
	<li>Distance Penalties removed for Attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>At the conclusion of war, gifts are bestowed upon both kingdoms.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Winning Kingdom - A boost to both land and honor, a large amount of specialist credits for military training, building credits equal to 150% of each province's total land.</li>
	<li>Losing Kingdom - Building credits equal to 50% of total land.</li>
</ul>

<p>After a war ends, a 72 day ceasefire will commence. During the ceasefire both Kingdoms remain in war relations, thus retaining the protection benefits while rebuilding. After 12 days however, either Kingdom may choose to leave the protection of war and venture back into the world. A careful decision must be made because during this ceasefire both Kingdoms benefit from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All land currently out with armies at war end returns home immediately, though the army still has to march home</li>
	<li>Instant population growth of 20% if we are under 50% of our maximum population</li>
	<li>Significantly increased birth rate</li>
	<li>30% reduction in training costs for all troops and thieves</li>
	<li>Military drafting costs reduced by 50%</li>
	<li>Any provinces affected by plague will have be instantly cured</li>
</ul>

<p>War is serious business and should be treated as such for the entire duration. Any agreements for a non-aggression pact, war win or duration manipulation, or trading land for a win are not honorable nor acceptable. This would constitute a fake war and is a violation of the Code of Conduct and subject to disciplinary actions by the Utopian Lords. You are advised not to tempt their judgment.</p>
