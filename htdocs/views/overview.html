<p><span class="initial">W</span>elcome to Utopia, a world like no other, full of war, intrigue, strategy and diplomacy!</p>

<p>I see you are interested in staking your claim in the world of Utopia with a province of your own my liege, joining the ranks of thousands of other players who are already building their province and kingdoms. Our advisors have put together this collection of knowledge to help you on your way to becoming a powerful ruler. We encourage new leaders take their time reading this wealth of information to help understand all the intricacies with managing a province in the world of Utopia. Within this vast tome, you'll find all sorts of information to help you on your way to becoming a powerful ruler, please read on to get started with an overview of Utopia.</p>

<p>Our scribes last updated this tome on January 31, 2018 and is current to Age 75: The Age of Empowering Enchantments. </p>

<h2 id="section-1">Basic Geography</h2>

<p>Utopia is a world of vast oceans covered with Islands and on each of these islands are Kingdoms. Every Kingdom has up to 25 provinces, one of which will be governed by you to rule over and do as you please. Together with your kingdom mates you will play a vital role in war, growth and diplomacy. Govern your peasantry, army, wizards, thieves and aim to conquer the world.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Time</h2>

<p>In the realm of Utopia time moves much faster than it does on Earth. That which you know as an "hour", is a full Utopian Day. Your day? A Utopian Month. And yes, this means there are 24 days in a month. Each Utopian Year contains seven months, beware of this as your advisors do not know of Earth time and will only speak of Utopian time.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every Age everyone starts anew, each province the same size with the same amount of resources giving each ruler and each kingdom the unique opportunity to take the ranks by storm. Each Age lasts about 12 Utopian Years, the equivalent of 12 Weeks in Earth time.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Currency</h2>

<p>The currency of choice in the Utopian World is the Gold Coin, noted by "gc". Unfortunately, the peasants of Utopia have no sense of the Dollar, Pound, Franc, or other Earth currencies that you may be familiar with.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Races</h2>

<p>The population of Utopia is made up of a mix of nine races with nine different personalities to choose from. To be successful you have to pick your race and personality carefully. Remember you are not alone and your kingdom needs you; race and personality choices are a very important decision that should be discussed with your kingdom. No single race or personality is so strong that it can stand alone. Finding the right mix can make or break an age. But enough of that, as you will be discussing this with your new co-inhabitants.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a little about the races.  For the specific details on both Races and Personalities for the current Age of Utopia, please click <a href="http://utopia-game.com/wol/chooser/age_details/" target="blank">here!</a></p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Avians</span> are a birdlike race with wings that travel lightning fast. As Avians prefer to attack from the air, their military do not use warhorses. Their forces strike with precision and accuracy from the air and disappear so quickly that it is impossible for opposing armies to ambush them. Avian Elites are ideally always on the move thus these provinces are best suited to be guided by rulers who can keep up with their speed!</li>
	<li><span class="red">Bocans</span> can take any form, from a satyr to a cat. The only way to spot a Bocan is their eyes, which will glow red, blue, or green. This characteristic makes them excellent thieves. But be careful, they are fiercely independent creatures and may not follow your orders as effectively as you may wish.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Dark Elves</span> are also known for their magical abilities and are evil individuals that like suffering and pain. The Dark Elven mages are the most efficient at performing magic and have developed a unique skill that allows them to generate mystical energies without using runes. Their hostile underground environment has allowed the Dark Elves to develop special offensive manoeuvres, their offensive troops are more efficient than average, as well as a unique spell that makes enemy troops completely harmless! Unfortunately, these rude living conditions also severely hinder their exploring abilities. Overall, Dark Elves are naturally oriented towards Magic and are very efficient at casting the hardest, and most powerful, spells, but they can also handle the Attacker and the Thieves roles very well.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Dwarves</span> are resilient. One may consider them the Jack of all trades in Utopia. Depending on the inclinations of those guiding them, they are capable of attacking, magic and thievery, and under the right rule, they can be great economists. Their sturdy and tough armies can make them a force to be reckoned with. They are incredibly handy and resourceful, constructing buildings quickly and at little cost. Dwarves are also a very hard-working race, with an above-average level of productivity.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Dryads</span> are shrouded in mystery.  Not many live to tell of their interactions with this race.  Sheltering deep in the forests and luring the unsuspecting with their beauty and charm to fight with extraordinary strength.  These masterfully elusive creatures wield unmatched power through a combination of cunning and finesse which, to their detriment, deals less overall damage to their enemies and requires an excess of planning to bring their armies back home.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Elves</span> are magical beings naturally inclined to spellcasting. While the mystical arts are their strongest quality they are formidable attackers. Their military are highly educated with a wealth of experience which allows them capabilities for any role they choose.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Faeries</span> are a quick, nimble and intelligent race, excelling at defending their lands. They are mischievous creatures, thriving on causing chaos - particularly via the methods of magic and thievery. While they may not always possess superior skill in these areas, these cunning tricksters are masters of damage and destruction.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Humans</span>, often considered the greediest race, are motivated by gold and prefer to focus their efforts on maximising their economic potential. They are skilful with money and have developed a number of tricks to extract the greatest possible profit from a situation, leading to higher than usual incomes. Humans are also adept at countering enemy attempts to target their powerful economies. Unfortunately, as on Earth, Humans in Utopia fumble when it comes to magic.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Orcs</span> are powerful, bloodthirsty attackers with a proclivity for smashing things. Their aggressive approach yields them great gains in battle, however, they are less adept at defending their own resources. Due to their penchant for fighting and killing, they inflict high casualties on their enemies, however, a lack of caution in their approach means they themselves tend to suffer heavy losses in battle.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-5">Personalities</h2>

<p>Unlike in your World where you are stuck with the personality you are born with in Utopia you can choose it. Just as the choice of race, choice of personality is one not to be taken lightly, it will influence your game play tremendously.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Rogues</span> are master thieves, well trained in the arts of stealing and sabotage. Operating in the darkest of shadows, they are able to perform dastardly acts others can scarcely imagine.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Mystics</span> are powerful mages, with the ability to cast unique spells which can visit devastating destruction upon their enemies.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Paladin</span> has a gift unlike any other, with the ability to cast spells on their Kingdom mates comes great responsibility! Paladins have developed their magic skills far beyond that of a regular spellcaster, with unique spells capable of providing bonuses unattainable through normal means. Capable of destruction, Paladins forge their path through the endowment of their allies, the noblest of causes.
	</li>
	<li><span class="red">Sages</span> are gifted scholars, renowned for their swift scientific progress and advanced knowledge. However, they are by nature cautious, and take great care to safeguard their learning.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Warriors</span> wield a great strength on the battlefield, preferring an aggressive approach to overpowering their enemies.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Tacticians</span> are strategic masterminds, targeting their enemies’ weaknesses with deadly cunning and precision. They are renowned for their speed on the battlefield.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Undead</span> will make any race unnatural beings with amazingly unique abilities. They are generally rotting to pieces and carry the plague (a highly contagious disease that will kill the living but seems to provide the Undead the strength they need to survive) with them wherever they walk. This strength allows them to continue fighting through even the most grievous of wounds, effectively lowering their casualties in battle.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The Heretic</span>, not a pure mage neither a perfect thief. They believe in the unorthodox combination of thievery and magic. Despised by the mystics and rogues they combine both fields into unique talents. Their visions give them rare bonuses, something of both thievery and magic with their own unique flavor added to it. Far above average in both fields but not as good as either the mystic or rogue in their specific fields.</li>
	<li><span class="red">The War Hero</span> is known for their great deeds on the battlefield, and for their firm belief that with risks come great rewards. They fight valiantly and reap rewards such as honor and promotions to elite ranks.</li>
</ul>
