<h2 id="1">Lobby</h2>

<img src="images/account1.jpg" alt="Lobby" style="padding-right:10px;float:left;height:100px">

<p>You have at least once, most likely several times entered Utopia by now, my Liege. Let me point out a few things you may have missed on your first visits. Upon entering you will land in the Lobby. For most of the age this place will only show you the name of the current age and the date it started as well as if it is currently up and running. Once the end of the age has been determined, it will appear here.</p>

<p>In the Lobby we are presented with the provinces available to our account, including any provinces we are currently sitting. It displays your Province name and location as well as our Kingdom name. Take comfort in reading that your province is alive as this may not always be the case! Utopia is a vast and dangerous land in which casualties are a common occurrence.</p>

<p>If you haven't found your home yet, this is where you can look for one. In recruitment you can see how many kingdoms are using the in game recruitment and how many of those may consider inviting you. Clicking on "x want players like you" will take you to a list of kingdoms you can apply to.
When a kingdom decides you are just the person they need to make their kingdom complete they will send you an invitation and said invitation will be displayed next to "invitations".</p>

<p>Underneath your province link you will find a quick link to this age's race and personality changes in case you need a reference as well as a link to the game rules.</p>

<p>Clicking on your province name, or that of a province you are sitting, will take you to the Throne page, my Liege. Enter if you dare!</p>

<h2 id="2">Game Account</h2>

<img src="images/account2.jpg" alt="Game Account" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;height:130px">

<p>The time has come, my Liege, to spend a little time on the less exciting but yet important things. While bureaucracy is kept to a minimum it still exists. May I direct your attention to the upper right corner of the screen, please?! You will see your account name with a drop down menu. It is here that you can do such things as removing advertising and changing your account information as well as your password. If you so choose you can add a custom theme or one of the integrated ones. You may also choose to set up a public profile.</p>

<h2 id="3">Bug Reporting</h2>

<img src="images/account3.jpg" alt="Bug Reporting" style="padding-right:10px;float:left;height:100px">

<p>Last but not least you will find the place to report bugs here. If you encounter a bug or what you perceive as a bug, do not hesitate to let the Utopian Lords know. Once you click on "report bug" you will be given a personal ID number. It is very important you use that ID while making a report so the Utopian Lords can properly investigate the issue and fix anything that needs fixing without further ado.</p>

<h2 id="4">Abuse Reporting</h2>

<img src="images/account4.jpg" alt="Abuse Reporting" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;height:150px">

<p>While we are on the subject of reporting, my Liege, let me point out how to report harassment, rule violations and abuse of mechanics as well as rude behavior, names and banners. Although we hope that you will never actually have to use these options, since Utopia is generally a very friendly and clean place, we would do you great disservice not to mention them.</p>

<p>While looking through kingdom pages you may come across an offensive banner. Banners have a direct report option when you mouse over the banner it will appear on the top right corner. The same is true for all forum posts in all forums in game as well as in the official game forum.</p>

<p>Anything else you would like to report such as fake wars, kingdoms abusing game mechanics, offensive kingdom or province names, people with multiple accounts, you will need to send an email to support at: <a href="mailto:UtopiaSupport@Utopia-Game.com">UtopiaSupport@Utopia-Game.com</a></p>

<p>The support team under the same email can also help you if you have problems logging in or if you have been temporarily banned for example.</p>

<h2 id="5">Province Settings</h2>

<img src="images/account5.jpg" alt="Province Settings" style="padding-right:10px;float:left;height:150px">

<p>At the bottom left you will find a preferences link, my Liege. This place bares some very powerful options for you.</p>

<p>It is here that you can change your province name. Beware though that such a change is only possible after not conducting any hostile actions for 24 hours and it requires credits which the Utopian Lords offer for sale in the shop.</p>

<p>In the case that you are unhappy with your race and personality selection you can change these, though you will have to start from scratch if you do so.</p>

<p>Your kingdom and province need your attention daily. Should you be unable to tend to your loyal subjects for an extended period of time you have two options to consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can either go into vacation mode which will temporarily pause your province where time will not pass and actions cannot be performed from or against us.  This option has a minimum time period of 72 hours.</li>
	<li>You can have a trusted kingdom member sit your province. This means they will be able to control your province while you are away.  Every province plays an important part in it's kingdom. It is most beneficial that your province continue growing and getting stronger while you are away. The minimum time before sitting can be cancelled is 1 hour and the maximum time a province can be sat per age is 21 days.  It should be noted that a minimum of 1 day will be removed from the 21 day limit each time a sitter is designated, regardless of the time sat. In order to set a sitter you will need to purchase credits from the Utopian Lords in the shop.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we do not enjoy the company of our fellow kingdom mates it is possible to uproot our province and move to a new kingdom. Please understand my liege that this process, called Random Move, will greatly impact our province networth as it is impossible to take everything with us. We encourage you to try and cooperate with your kingdom mates but understand not everyone gets along. If it pleases my liege you may also consider Abandoning your province; if you feel like you've not only made a mess of things but are also not getting along you can choose to either Abandon or burn your province to the ground. If you abandon your province will be left empty, allowing another player to take over from where you left off. If you wish my liege you can instead choose to burn your province to the ground, preventing another player from taking over your province, forcing them to start anew. Please take great care in performing these actions my liege as they cannot be undone!</p>
