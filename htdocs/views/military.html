<h2 id="1">Drafting Soldiers</h2>

<p>It is imperative that we maintain an army for the survival of our province. The first step to developing our offenses and defenses is to recruit from the ranks of our peasants. We can reach out to our wizards to increase the efficiency of our drafting by having them cast Patriotism over our lands, this will allow more peasants to be drafted without raising the speed and cost of the draft.</p>

<p>Our recruiters can draft soldiers at varying speeds; however, the faster we recruit the more it will cost us per soldier and the less gold we have per day to train those we recruited so a balance should be maintained.</p>

<h2 id="2">Training your Military</h2>

<img src="images/military2.jpg" alt="Training Military" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;height:150px;">

<p>Once we have soldiers, we can begin their training. We can order the training of offense and defense specialists, elites and thieves in the same place. We require a military presence to both defend our lands and conquer our enemies, so a balance between defensive and offensive capacity is required.</p>

<p>However, each province and kingdom can have their own opinions on how to assign their armies. Some of these opinions are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>100% elites - The strengths of this strategy depends on your race but running this strategy as an attacker, such as an undead or an orc, would be suicidal and would be a detriment to your kingdom. Elites are also very costly so it can take a long time to train an army full of them.</li>
	<li>High Defense, No Offense - With such high offense with attackers, becoming unbreakable is very difficult to achieve but can be a great benefit to our kingdom if we are able to get there; however, as the saying goes "There is always a bigger fish" and running this strategy can be very risky.</li>
	<li>High Defense, Low Offense - Typically used by thief- and mage-style provinces, it provides strong defensive capabilities while still providing us with some recourse to either ambush a hit against us or helping to keep a chained target down while in war. This is a very common strategy and easy to maintain.</li>
	<li>Middle Defense and Offense - Utilized by hybrids that wish to be a little harder to break than an attacker would be, but still having enough offense to make a larger hit or several smaller hits against our enemies. While this is a solid strategy for some provinces in a kingdom, if too many operate like this then the kingdom can suffer as the enemy could more easily achieve unbreakables and we may not be able to do multiple Traditional Marches per wave due to lower offense.</li>
	<li>High Offense, Low Defense - "The best defense is a good offense" is a long-time battle strategy. While this can be a good strategy to help stop the enemy gaining any unbreakables, we may be attacked multiples times due to the low defense so it relies on us making multiple hits and having a steady stream of incoming land to offset that damage too. This is a good strategy for people that can regularly keep their army out.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3">Paying your Army</h2>

<p>I caution you though my liege, we do not want to recruit too large an army or the income received from our remaining peasants will not be enough to support their wages. Wages are important as they affect the efficiency of our military and should be adjusted for maximum strategic effect.</p>

<ul>
	<li>50% - Training Pump - While this will slowly reduce their military efficiency, it will allow us to train more troops. It is best used only during fortified stance or in the end-of-war ceasefire.</li>
	<li>50% - Chained Survival - When in war, if we are chained heavily we will likely not have the income to sustain much of an army so we should lower our wages to 50% and ask for aid from our kingdom mates if we are losing gold per day. When heavily chained, we receive a military efficiency bonus from the gang-bang protection so the slow lowering of the efficiency due to wages is pretty negligible.</li>
	<li>100 to 150% - Maintaining - Used to maintain a steady military efficiency and wages balance. Best used during normal or aggressive when looking around for a war.</li>
	<li>200% - Pumped for War - In times of hostilities and war, paying our troops 200% wages will increase their efficiency which can mean the difference between being unbreakable or not for thieves or mystics; or for attackers, being able to make a Traditional March per general or having to conquest for reduced land gains with one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wages are not required for regular soldiers, thieves or troops that are currently in training.</p>

<h2 id="4">The Military Advisor</h2>

<img src="images/military4.jpg" alt="Military Advisor" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;height:150px;">

<p>While our throne page will show our offense and defense totals, the Military Advisor will detail what portion of our army is at home and the defense amount they are protecting our lands with, and armies that are out on missions. You can use this information to arrange when our troops will need to be sent out again.</p>

<p>The military efficiency from just wages is reported in the Wage Rate report while the total efficiency from wages, gang-bang protection, and buildings is available in the Military Strength area. You can keep an eye on your effectiveness numbers and adjust your wages and buildings accordingly to keep the desired minimum booster.</p>
