<h2 id="section-1">Scientists</h2>

<p>Sciences, my liege, are the study of knowledge and create our pathway into the future. By studying the laws that govern our being and understanding the affects of these laws we can strengthen ourselves in all that we do. The mystery of magic and thievery, our military prowess, even our methods of production can all be enhanced through the power of study with an investment in time devoted to those fields. The students of our province will lead us into the future with your careful direction. With each passing day they become smarter and stronger in their understanding of their subject of study. Over time these students will become so proficient in their craft that their experience will award them much stronger insight into the development of their devoted study. But be careful my Lord, when assigning our students to a new task they will forget all they have learned from their previous endeavor so that they can focus entirely on their new subject. While assigning your students to new tasks can be beneficial it should be carefully considered as this can not be undone.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">The Arts and Sciences</h2>

<p>The scientists of our province are very unique. They are recruited to our ranks through a careful process of selection and do not become a part of our general population, while our laboratories can provide us with a better method of recruiting new scientists to our lands there is never any guarantee our work will be productive. However, with each passing day that we do not successfully recruit a new scientist our efforts will become stronger. Once recruited they will quiet themselves away in their craft and seclude themselves in the Universities of our lands where they are better protected from the outside world and dedicated to their study. It will take several days for a new recruit of any particular subject to begin their scientific developments. Once learning has begun there are several levels of mastery a scientist can attain, which are: Novice, Graduate and Professor. With each level your scientists will provide stronger and stronger benefits to our scientific discoveries. Now I will take a moment to introduce you to the various subjects of study for our scientists:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Alchemy:</span> Alchemy is the art of changing lead to gold. Knowledge in this area will help you increase your daily tax revenues by creating more value out of the resources you have.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Tools:</span> Creating better tools means more efficient workers. By developing this area of knowledge, you will be able to significantly increase the efficiency of the workers within your buildings.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Housing:</span> By improving the quality &amp; efficiency of housing throughout your lands, you will be able increase the amount of people living within your province. This provides you the opportunity to substantially increase your population without adding more lands.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Production:</span> By researching better production techniques, you can improve the quality of your crops and improve the yield from the towers across your lands. This allows you to dedicate more lands to other, more fruitful ventures for your province.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Military:</span> Combat strategy and techniques can only be learned through intense studies. Through this study your military will become more powerful on offense and defense.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Crime:</span> The study of crime can prove invaluable to your methods of thievery. A better understanding of the criminal procedures will help us conduct more effective operations against others as well as provide a stronger defense against enemy thieves.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Channeling:</span> Magic is a powerful force of the lands. By increasing your knowledge of the history of this art, you can improve your wizards' abilities to cast spells and defend your lands from enemy spell-casters. Dedication to this art can not be replicated anywhere.</li>
