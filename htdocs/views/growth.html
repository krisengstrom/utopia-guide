<h2 id="1">Your People</h2>

<img src="images/people1.jpg" alt="Your People" style="padding-right:10px;float:left;height:150px;">

<p>As our esteemed leader, it is up to you to find a balance between our economy and military that works for our goals. Too many peasants means a smaller military presence that will open us to heavier attacks from our enemies. Too big of an army means that our peasants are unable to generate in the income needed to pay them.</p>

<p>When we gain land, our population increases allowing us to strengthen our economy or military; however, when we lose land our maximum population lowers and our peasants and military at home will slowly leave each tick. Should we lose all our peasants, our lands will crumble and be destroyed. It is easier to quickly convert military back to peasantry than it is to turn peasants into an army. I urge you, me liege, to consider your balance carefully and watch over your military size.</p>

<h2 id="2">Employment</h2>

<img src="images/people2.jpg" alt="Employment" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;height:120px;">

<p>To maintain a healthy economy, our peasants need employment to generate income. Once our lands are built, peasants will be able to get employment; however, there is a limited number of jobs available. Our Buildings Advisor will advise the number of jobs available; however, the available jobs is greater than 50% of our total population and if we maximize the employment then our military capacity will diminish.</p>

<h2 id="3">Taxes</h2>

<img src="images/people3.jpg" alt="Taxes" style="padding-right:20px;float:left;height:140px;">

<p>We garner our income from collecting taxes from the peasants. The income we receive comes from various sources, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Employed Peasants</li>
	<li>Unemployed Peasants (at a rate 1/3rd of the employed peasants)</li>
	<li>Prisoners (at a rate approximately 1/5th of the employed peasants)</li>
	<li>Banks (Review with Building Advisor for what our banks are generating)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4">The State Advisor</h2>

<img src="images/people4.jpg" alt="State Advisor" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;height:100px;">

<p>Our Affairs of the State Advisor provides details on our current population, economy, current highlights, as well as the recent trends for incoming and outgoing resources.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Our Population - Provides details of our current and maximum population that our lands can support, and the breakdown of our breakdown of our denizens showing their employment. You can use this information to make adjustments for when our thieves or military is unable to perform their tasks due to drastic housing shortages.</li>
	<li>Our Economy - Report on our expected income and wages for the upcoming tick as well as show the employment level of our peasants. You can use these details to adjust wages to ensure our army can be supported by our current economic gains.</li>
	<li>Current Highlights - Outline the networth and land size, honor standing, as well as our current standing against all provinces across all kingdoms.</li>
	<li>Recent Trends - Display our incoming and outgoing resources of gold, peasants, food, and runes for the previous tick, the current month and the previous month.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5">Building Efficiency</h2>

<img src="images/people5.jpg" alt="Building Efficiency" style="padding-right:10px;float:left;height:80px;">

<p>With the exception of capacity buildings, such as homes, stables, and dungeons, building efficiency will increase or decrease the benefits received from each whole percentage for the building. We can improve your building efficiency with peasants to fulfill jobs and by assigning our scientists to study Tools. While more employed peasants increase our efficiency, unfulfilled jobs will lower efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="6">Exploration</h2>

<img src="images/people6.jpg" alt="Exploration" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;height:150px;">

<p>One option available to us to increase our land size is to explore by equipping an expedition with soldiers and gold. The land from this trip will become available over 24 ticks. In order to explore, we must have at least half our current existing acres built or undergoing construction and the explore pool must have enough land in it. Each kingdom has a set exploration pool that and province can be used up by casting paradise or exploring and it will increase slightly with each day.</p>

<p>The cost of exploration will increase depending on our size, and it will increase 500% during war, end-of-war ceasefire, and during fortified. It is recommended to explore during normal and aggressive only to avoid these extra costs.</p>

<h2 id="7">Construction</h2>

<img src="images/people7.jpg" alt="Construction" style="padding-right:20px;float:left;height:120px;">

<p>When we have unbuilt acres, it is strongly recommended to build them as soon as possible. The construction cost and time can be impacted by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Casting Builder's Boon - Increase speed 25%</li>
	<li>Use Accelerated Construction - Twice the cost for double the speed</li>
	<li>During Fortified Stance - Half the cost and double the speed</li>
	<li>Be a dwarf - Free construction and half the normal building speed at all times</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="8">Buildings and their effects</h2>

<img src="images/people8.jpg" alt="Building Effects" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;height:150px;">

<p>Built acres can provide a huge advantage to our province and you will need to have an understanding on how each building operates.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b class="red">Homes</b> - While all land houses peasants, dedicating land to housing provides additional capacity for peasants as well as increasing birth rates.  Homes are also the only building that do not provide jobs so they can be very useful in manipulating your required workforce.
	<li><b class="red">Mills</b> - Reduces the resources needed for exploring, and construction costs.
	<li><b class="red">Training Grounds</b> - Designating a portion of your land for your troops to train will increase our Offensive Military Efficiency.
	<li><b class="red">Barracks</b> - By providing our troops an area to be more organized we are able to reduce our attack times.
	<li><b class="red">Guard Stations</b> - Decrease resource losses when attacked with land grabbing, plunder or massacre attacks, does not impact abducts.
	<li><b class="red">Guilds</b> - Our wizards need a place to live and study.  Our Guilds will take a small number of peasants each day and train them into wizards. Guilds are also required for us to cast self spells and the amount of Guilds will impacts their duration.
	<li><b class="red">Thieves' Dens</b> - Increases our thieves per acre as well as reducing the losses of thieves during operations.
	<li><b class="red">Laboratories</b> - Increases the chances of scientists joining our ranks per tick.
	<li><b class="red">Stables</b> - Breeds, trains and houses War Horses which can be used by our military to strengthen our offense.
	<li><b class="red">Farms</b> - With the exception of Undeads, food is vital to the growth of any province. Without it, our peasants and military will starve! It is important that we keep an adequate portion of our land as farms, or we will find our province quickly fall to ruins.
	<li><b class="red">Banks</b> - Produces a raw amount of gold per tick as well as provide a percentage boost to our current income.
	<li><b class="red">Armories</b> - Better prepares our army and decreases draft costs, training costs and wages.
	<li><b class="red">Forts</b> - Increases Defensive Military Efficiency.
	<li><b class="red">Hospitals</b> - Decreases our military losses during all attacks plus has a bonus chance of curing the plague each tick.
	<li><b class="red">Towers</b> - Produce new runes each day, giving you the ability to cast spells.
	<li><b class="red">Watchtowers</b> - Guards our lands against enemy thieves by increasing our chances to catch them and lowers losses incurred from any successful operations against us.
	<li><b class="red">Universities</b> - Lowers the chance of our scientists being abducted.
	<li><b class="red">Dungeons</b> - We need a place to hold prisoners gained from making attacks. Prisoners will generate a small amount of revenue from the work they perform while incarcerated, however Prisoners are most useful when we send them with our armies to attack, they can be used in tandem with Mercenaries.
</ul>

<h2 id="9">The Building Advisor</h2>

<img src="images/people9.jpg" alt="Advisor" style="padding-right:20px;float:left;height:150px;">

<p>To check on the status of our buildings and their benefits, we should check on our Building Advisor regularly. This report provides information on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Current Building Efficiency</li>
	<li>Available Jobs</li>
	<li>Available Workers (aka current peasants)</li>
	<li>Building Quantities and Percentage of Total lands</li>
	<li>Current effects from built lands</li>
	<li>Schedule for incoming exploration lands and buildings in progress</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10">Honor and Ranks</h2>

<img src="images/people10.jpg" alt="Building Effects" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;width:150px">

<p>As our province performs noble deeds, such as traditional marching against an enemy without anonymity, or executing certain mystic and thief operations, the honor of the province will increase which will reward us with a higher rank. Alternately, when we are subjected to attacks, we can lose our honor. Honor gains are drastically reduced when taking advantage of enemies with significantly lower networth than us, or by being a pest towards substantially larger opponents.</p>

<p>Upon the founding of our province, we begin with no honor. However, over the first seven and a half real-life days our honor will steadily increase on it's own without us needing to take any actions. With each increase in rank, we received bonuses to our population, offensive military efficiency, income, modified wizards and thieves per acres, as well as votes. The titles of the ranks in order from lowest to highest are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Peasant</li>
	<li>Knight or Lady</li>
	<li>Lord or Noble Lady</li>
	<li>Baron or Baroness</li>
	<li>Viscount or Viscountess</li>
	<li>Count or Countess</li>
	<li>Marquis or Marchioness</li>
	<li>Duke or Duchess</li>
	<li>Prince or Princess</li>
</ul>
