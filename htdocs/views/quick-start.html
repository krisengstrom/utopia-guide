<h2 id="section-1">Choosing your Race and Personality</h2>

<p>Eager to start my liege? Allow me to give you some quick practical suggestions as your trustworthy advisor. To start you should consider your future role as it is essential in deciding your Race and Personality. On one hand if you prefer powerful magic or thievery to hurt your opponents backed by a sturdy army, then look for the Elves, Faeries or Bocans. Those with the highest defensive values on their elite warriors and bonuses to magic and thievery. On the other hand there are those who prefer raw military power such as the reckless and relentless Orcs; the overwhelming might of the Dryad and their powerful elites; the Avians for their unmatched speed; Humans who use their greed for gold to power their province and military; and, Dwarves who are masters of construction.</p>

<p>Now that you have decided on your race my liege there is another choice ahead. What is your personality? Do you cover your racial weaknesses or further your strengths? For rulers having picked a thievery or magic oriented race I would recommend to pick a personality like the Rogue or Mystic to further boost your natural strengths. Other personalities such as the Sage or Heretic are also well-suited as they enhance your provinces Science or Thievery and Magic. Races with low military attack times or strong economies can look at increasing their durability by selecting the Cleric which will help with a reduction in troop losses. A strong tactician can control the battlefield with unmatched speed.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Building your Province</h2>

<p>Land alone is nice to have, but without buildings and infrastructure, it is of little use to anyone. We have a variety of buildings to choose to build and how We structure our province is up to you. Our Internal Affairs Advisor can help provide details on the benefits of building various structures, but there is no perfect or ideal balance for growth. You will find that having mass quantities of a given building decreases the effectiveness of those buildings.</p>

<p>A few of the highly recommended buildings are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Farms</span> - Food is vital to the growth of any and every province. Without it, your peasants and military will starve! It is important that you keep an adequate portion of your land as farms, or you will find your province quickly fall to ruins.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Guilds</span> - Unlike all our other units, either the military footmen or the thieves, wizards are not trained by using gold. Our ascendant wizards will have to go through intensive studies in Guilds before being able to serve you properly. They are an absolute necessity. Additionally, the more guilds we have, the greater chance of successful self-spells and the longer the duration.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Towers</span> - These are massive buildings that are used in order to channel mystic energies produced by the Earth into small stones called runes. Runes are the expended by your wizards while casting magic spells.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-3">Training your Military</h2>

<p>In order to protect your province from aggressors, your peasants should be trained into more advanced roles. By training your peasants, you will be better suited to defend your land and conquer other land areas. The general foot soldiers are drafted from your peasants and can then be trained in either offensive, defensive specialists, Elites or thieves. Offensive and defensive specialists are good at what they do, but cannot perform the other role. An defensive specialist can only defend and vice versa. The Elites are the unique units that differ between the races. Please make sure that your elites suit your role my liege. Elites can both attack and defend and they do it with different strength. Some elites have very high attacking power, some have good defensive power and some are balanced. Lastly one can train thieves, specialized in gathering intelligence on your enemies, robbing goods and all the actions the daylight should not see.</p>

<p>Before going into detail let me please explain an important concept my liege. That of population per acre my liege, Every acre of your province has room for 25 people minimum, whether its peasants, wizards, thieves or military. This is mentioned as population per acre (PPA). When you grow in acres you will thus obtain additional space for people, which is needed to protect your new lands. To maintain a healthy province we often talk in units per acre like thieves per acre (TPA) instead of actual numbers.</p>

<p>A balanced approach is often required in terms of training your troops sire. Only offense leaves you unable to defend your lands. Running no offense and only defense is only advised for the thievery and magic specialists where they train between 12 and 18 units per acre into defense specialists or sturdy elites.</p>

<p>If you prefer a brute force as measure to scare enemies we suggest you train roughly 1/3rd into defensive specialists and the rest into elites and or offensive specialists. Of course my liege you are free to tweak these numbers as you see fit, but these numbers will guarantee at least a decent province.</p>

<p>Now the hidden department of every province, thieves and wizards. Wizards are loyal but hard to obtain as they can only be obtained from guilds. Whereas thieves can be trained from soldiers. Rumors are thievery and magic users have been seen with as many as 10 to 12 units per acre devoted to wizards and thieves. Attackers on the other hand most often run between 3 and 5 units per acre in this area. A higher amount of thieves per acre (TPA) or wizards per acre (WPA) guarantees a higher success in damaging your enemies.</p>

<h2 id="section-4"> Introduce yourself in the Kingdom Forum</h2>

<p>My liege every kingdom has their own preferred ways of communication. It is highly recommended to get in touch with your fellow kingdom mates. Ignoring them might lead to your removal as they might think of you as a spy. Thus it is common to introduce yourself in the forums. There you can ask all your questions and meet the others. They will be able to tell you what their standard means of communication are and can hopefully answer your questions. Additionally I highly recommend it that you send a personal introduction message to the monarch of your kingdom. You can find your monarch on your kingdom page where the province has a (M) behind it.</p>
